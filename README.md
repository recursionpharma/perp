# Python Environment Resolver Profiler (PERP)

A Repository for housing scripts to generate your own Python environment
resolver benchmark.

## How it works

You will need to provide your own one-to-one installation files for each of the
following optional formats:

- `environment.yml` - For conda and mamba resolvers. This version should use
  only conda channels and/or meta-channels.
- `environment-pip.yml` - Similar to above, but should use PyPI versions of all
  dependencies.
- `Pipfile` - Used by pyenv.
- `Pipfile.lock` - (TODO: generate automatically in `run-suite.sh`) Can be
  generated by running pyenv locally.
- `pyproject.toml` - Used by poetry.
- `poetry.lock` - (TODO: generate automatically in `run-suite.sh`) Can be
  generated by running poetry locally.
- `requirements.in` - This is the unpinned requirements file used by pip's
  resolver.
- `requirements.txt` - Locked version of all of your dependencies generated
  from `pip-compile requirements.in`

We have leveraged [DepHell](https://github.com/dephell/dephell) largely to
do the majority of the conversions and then executed `poetry`, `pip-compile`,
and `pyenv` locally to generate the requisite lockfiles for each of their
respective resolvers. (This step can probably be automated away from the user).
